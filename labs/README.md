# Python Fundamental Labs

- labs have been moved to its own repository at: [https://github.com/rambasnet/Python-Fundamentals-Lab](https://github.com/rambasnet/Python-Fundamentals-Lab)
- separating should make it easier to work with GitHub Classroom
- in the lab repo, see `readonly_lab` which is supposed to readonly for students
- they can create their own `labs` folder in the repo and work on each lab
- having a read only copy provides a good reference in case students accidently change part of the code they're not supposed to!
